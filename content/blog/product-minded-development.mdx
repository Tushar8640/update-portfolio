When I say **product-minded**, I mean I optimize for outcomes, not just code output.

## What you can expect when working with me

- Clear scope and acceptance criteria
- Clean, maintainable code (TypeScript-first)
- Thoughtful UX and accessibility basics
- Practical performance and reliability checks

## A simple delivery loop

1. Confirm scope + acceptance criteria
2. Build the smallest correct version
3. Polish UI/UX + run quick checks
4. Deliver with a short summary and next steps

If you want help shipping a feature or fixing a bug, send your repo link and steps to reproduce.
