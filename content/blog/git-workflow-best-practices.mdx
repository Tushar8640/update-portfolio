Git is more than version control - it's communication. Your commit history tells a story. Let's make it a good one.

## The Golden Rules

1. **Commit early, commit often** - Small, focused commits
2. **Write meaningful messages** - Future you will thank you
3. **Never commit to main directly** - Use branches
4. **Review before pushing** - Check your changes
5. **Pull before you push** - Stay synchronized

## Branch Naming Convention

```bash
# Feature branches
feature/user-authentication
feature/payment-integration

# Bug fixes
fix/login-redirect-issue
fix/memory-leak-dashboard

# Hotfixes
hotfix/critical-security-patch

# Refactoring
refactor/database-queries
refactor/component-structure

# Chores (maintenance)
chore/update-dependencies
chore/configure-ci

# Documentation
docs/api-endpoints
docs/setup-guide
```

## Commit Message Format

Use **Conventional Commits**:

```bash
# Format
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>

# Examples
feat(auth): add Google OAuth integration

Implemented OAuth 2.0 flow for Google sign-in.
Users can now authenticate using their Google accounts.

Closes #123

fix(dashboard): resolve memory leak in chart component

The chart component was not properly cleaning up event listeners,
causing memory to accumulate on route changes.

- Added cleanup in useEffect return
- Removed unused Chart.js instance

Fixes #456

perf(api): optimize database queries

Reduced query time by 60% by adding proper indexes
and implementing query batching.

- Added index on user_id column
- Implemented batch loading for related data
- Reduced N+1 queries

refactor(components): extract reusable Button component

chore(deps): update Next.js to v15

docs(readme): add deployment instructions
```

## Commit Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature | `feat(auth): add 2FA` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `fix(api): handle null users` |
| `docs` | Documentation | `docs(readme): update setup` |
| `style` | Formatting | `style: fix indentation` |
| `refactor` | Code restructure | `refactor: simplify logic` |
| `perf` | Performance | `perf(db): add indexes` |
| `test` | Tests | `test(auth): add unit tests` |
| `chore` | Maintenance | `chore: update deps` |

## Feature Branch Workflow

```bash
# 1. Update main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-dashboard

# 3. Make changes and commit
git add src/components/Dashboard.tsx
git commit -m "feat(dashboard): create Dashboard component"

# 4. Push to remote
git push origin feature/new-dashboard

# 5. Create Pull Request on GitHub/GitLab

# 6. After review and approval, merge via PR
# 7. Delete branch after merging
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/new-dashboard
```

## Handling Merge Conflicts

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# If conflicts occur
# <<<<<<< HEAD
# Your changes
# =======
# Their changes
# >>>>>>> branch-name

# 1. Open conflicted files
# 2. Resolve conflicts manually
# 3. Remove conflict markers
# 4. Test your changes

# Stage resolved files
git add .

# Complete the merge
git commit -m "merge: resolve conflicts with main"
```

## Interactive Rebase

Clean up your commit history:

```bash
# Rebase last 3 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# In editor, you'll see:
# pick abc123 feat: add feature A
# pick def456 fix: typo
# pick ghi789 feat: add feature B

# Change to:
# pick abc123 feat: add feature A
# fixup def456 fix: typo
# pick ghi789 feat: add feature B

# Save and exit - commits will be combined
```

## Git Hooks with Husky

Automate checks before commits:

```bash
npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged

# package.json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged",
      "commit-msg": "commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"
    }
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "prettier --write"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Useful Git Commands

```bash
# View commit history
git log --oneline --graph --all

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Stash changes
git stash
git stash pop

# Cherry-pick specific commit
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# View changes in staging
git diff --staged

# Amend last commit
git commit --amend

# Show who changed each line
git blame <file>

# Search commits
git log --grep="bug fix"

# Find which commit introduced a bug
git bisect start
git bisect bad # Current version is bad
git bisect good <commit-hash> # This version was good
```

## Pull Request Best Practices

**Good PR:**
- Small and focused (< 400 lines)
- Has descriptive title
- Includes description of changes
- Links to relevant issues
- Passes all CI checks
- Has screenshots for UI changes
- Requests specific reviewers

**PR Template:**

```markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## Testing
How to test these changes

## Screenshots
(if applicable)

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Self-reviewed code
- [ ] Commented hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] Updated documentation
- [ ] No new warnings
- [ ] Added tests
- [ ] All tests pass
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Don't:**
- Commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Make huge commits mixing multiple changes
- Use vague messages like "fix stuff" or "wip"
- Commit commented-out code
- Push directly to main/master
- Rewrite public history

**✅ Do:**
- Use .gitignore properly
- Make atomic commits (one logical change)
- Write descriptive messages
- Remove dead code
- Use feature branches
- Communicate with your team

## Team Workflow Strategy

### GitFlow
For projects with scheduled releases:
- `main` - Production
- `develop` - Integration
- `feature/*` - New features
- `release/*` - Release preparation
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes

### Trunk-Based Development
For continuous deployment:
- Everyone commits to `main`
- Short-lived feature branches (< 2 days)
- Feature flags for incomplete work
- Automated testing and deployment

## Conclusion

Good Git practices are a team sport. Consistency matters more than perfection. Pick a workflow, document it, and stick to it.

**Remember:** Your commit history is a form of documentation. Make it count.
